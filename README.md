# Unlock the Power of Chinese OCR with Amazon Bedrock and the Anthropic Claude Model

Introduction


To address the unique challenges of Chinese OCR and enable the seamless ingestion of diverse document types into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-ready knowledge base, this solution leverages the advanced capabilities of the Anthropic Claude model, made available through Amazon Bedrock. By integrating the Anthropic Claude model's state-of-the-art vision and language understanding abilities, we can create a comprehensive document processing pipeline that accurately detects layout elements, recognizes Chinese characters, and extracts structured content from complex documents.

Solution Overview

The proposed solution consists of the following key components:

1. PDF Conversion: Use pdfplumber to convert the input PDF documents into high-resolution images, optimizing the input for the Anthropic Claude model's vision capabilities.
2. Text Extraction with Layout Awareness: Utilize pdfplumber to extract the textual content from the original PDF document, enabling cross-validation of the OCR results.
3. Content Integration: Combine the extracted text, table cell content, and image descriptions, preserving the original order and structure of the document.
4. Output Generation: Generate the final output as a structured text file, which can then be chunked into smaller segments to serve as input for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution.

The following diagram depicts the workflow of the proposed solution:

Prerequisites and Setup

To implement this solution, you'll need the following:

1. [AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup): Access to an AWS account with the necessary permissions to deploy and manage the required services.
2. [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/): Utilize AWS IAM to manage user access and permissions for the various AWS services used in this solution.
3. Python Environment: A Python development environment with the necessary libraries, such as pdfplumber and other PDF parsing tools.

Solution Architecture and Deployment

The solution architecture is deployed using a combination of AWS services, including:

1. [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/): Integrate the Anthropic Claude model through Amazon Bedrock to enable the advanced vision and language understanding capabilities required for Chinese OCR.
2. [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/): Utilize SageMaker Processing Jobs to batch-process the PDF pages, improving the overall efficiency and scalability of the solution.
3. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/): Executes code in response to triggers, allowing for serverless processing and integration between other AWS services.
4. [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/): Triggers the document processing workflow and coordinates the execution of the different steps.
5. [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/): Provides storage for the input PDF documents and the processed output.

The following diagram depicts the solution architecture using various AWS services.

_Figure 2: This architecture demonstrates a serverless, event-driven approach to data processing that combines storage, event management, serverless computing, machine learning, and AI services to create a scalable and efficient data processing workflow._

Conclusion

This serverless architecture allows for efficient scaling and processing of documents. The event-driven approach, starting from S3 uploads triggering EventBridge rules, through Lambda functions initiating SageMaker Processing jobs, and finally utilizing Bedrock for advanced AI processing, creates a streamlined and powerful solution for Chinese document analysis and OCR tasks.
