Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Analyze the image content and identify the types of content present (graphs, tables, text).

2. For each type of content in the image:
   a. If it's a graph/diagram/figure:
      - Provide a short description of the graph/diagram/figure
      - Do not provide a fake link
   b. If it's a table:
      - Extract all cells correctly
      - Compare the extracted cell values with the corresponding section in the PDF text
      - Use the PDF text as the correct version if there are discrepancies
      - Format the table in markdown
      - Ensure each cell value is aligned with its column
   c. If it's text and not cell values of (b):
      - Extract the text
      - Compare the extracted text with the corresponding section in the PDF text
      - Use the PDF text as the correct version if there are discrepancies
      - Ensure there are no duplicates in both (b) and (c)

3. Maintain the original order of content as it appears in the image.

4. Use the **ORIGINAL MAIN LANGUAGE** in the PDF page, **DONOT** do translation.

5. Format the final content in clean, structured markdown.

6. Ensure that all content is included and accurately represented.

7. **DONOT** add any prefix before <result>.

Present your final result within <result> tags. The content inside these tags should be the clean, structured markdown representation of the PDF page content, suitable for use as RAG input.

Return <filename> and <page_number> info in a JSON format.

Remember to include all relevant information from both the PDF text and the image content, prioritizing accuracy and maintaining the original order and language of the content.
